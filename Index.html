      <h1>Disclosure of Assumptions and Disclaimer</h1>
      <p>
        This conceptual representation is meant to demonstrate the raw power of interest—whether it
        is working for you or against you. Care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of the
        information presented, but even so, because there are several moving parts, certain
        assumptions had to be made and relied upon in making these calculations. Although the
        figures in this presentation may be helpful in making decisions, they should not be relied
        upon in place of your own due diligence.
        <br /><br />
        Among the assumptions made are the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That you will qualify for life insurance under the presented parameters: that your health
          and history are such that you are insurable; that you have enough insurable interest
          (based on, among other things, your age and income) to qualify for the amount of death
          benefit in the plan; and that you have enough income and liquid assets to qualify for the
          amount of premium going into the plan.
        </li>
        <li
          >That the insurance company providing coverage will continue to pay dividends at their
          projected rate (the rate projected in the illustration, which is based on the current
          dividend scale).
        </li>
        <li>
          That the debt information you provided us is accurate, and the interest rates presented
          will not change. That the principal balance will not increase and will decrease as you
          continue to make your debt payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          That you will follow the plan as presented. Although the plan is flexible, and you have
          the freedom to make changes as time passes (and you should as circumstances arise), any
          changes you make to your plan will have an effect on the overall outcome.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If some or all of these assumptions prove, over time, not to be true, it could have anywhere
        from slight to significant changes to your plan. Although we believe this is among the
        safest places to put your money and certainly the best option we are aware of to pay off
        debt without sacrificing retirement and other financial plans, no decision, including
        decisions related to place your money, is without some risk.
        <br /><br />
        All rates of return are projected and are by no means guaranteed. Like all financial plans,
        we can make recommendations based on patterns in the past and signs about what will happen
        in the future, but we cannot see the future.

        The conclusions depicted in the illustrations are based on the specific information you
        provided, and to the extent anything you provided is imprecise or inaccurate, it will have a

        Not everyone will qualify for an IGIC. Some will be uninsurable. Others will qualify, but
        not for the full amount desired. Individual circumstances and qualifications always vary.

      <h1> How Does the G.O.L.D.E.N. Program Work? </h1>
      <p
        >One of Einstein’s proudest accomplishments was the Rule of 72. With it, Einstein created a
        formula to determine how long it will take for interest to cause your principal investment,
        or debt, to double. <br /><br />
        The calculation is simple: divide your interest rate into 72, and the resulting number is
        the number of years it will take for your investment (or debt) to double.
        <br /><br />
        If you invest $100 dollars in a vehicle where you get a 4% annual rate of return (which
        return is compounded), then the Rule of 72 tells us that you will have $200 (double your
        investment) in 18 years (72 divided by 4).
        <br /><br />
        If you have a $100 debt incurring an interest rate of 18%, then the Rule of 72 tells us that
        (barring any payments in the meantime), you will owe $200 on that debt in four years (72
        divided by 18). Of course, this calculation assumes you aren’t making regular payments
        toward the debt (and you will be). Nevertheless, it is a helpful tool for illustrating just
        how powerful interest is.
        <br /><br />
        Traditionally, we think about money as linear. One-dimensional. We earn it, we hold it for a
        time (during which time we may invest), then we spend it. Before we spend it, we have to
        choose how that dollar will provide us the most benefit. Do we meet the urgent needs and buy
        groceries or fix the roof? Do we think ahead to the future and buy term insurance? Or do we
        reward ourselves with a vacation? A single dollar can only be used towards one of these
        things, so we must choose carefully. After all, once we spend it, it has exhausted its
        usefulness, and we must replenish our store of money through additional earnings. But that’s
        not how we should be thinking about money.
        <br /><br />
        Instead, we should consider a dollar not as part of a timeline, with an effective start and
        an end, but rather as a mountain spring that produces constantly and forever.
        <br /><br />
        The GOLDEN program is based on two fundamental principles: (1) any dollar you earn can be a
        dollar that works for you forever, and (2) if interest works for you instead of against you,
        you will not just be debt free, but wealthy.
        <br /><br />
        Other debt programs have the chief (and only) goal of eliminating your debt. You scrimp and
        save, make limited purchases, and put all your money towards your debt. And if your goal is
        merely to get out of debt, many of these programs work very well for that. But they do so at
        the expense of your long-term goals. Indeed, after spending all of your extra money on debt,
        when you finally free yourself from your creditors, you find yourself proclaiming “Financial
        Freedom!” and then you realize that although you’re debt free, you’re also broke. And you
        have now lost your best earning years.
        <br /><br />
        You don’t have to choose between paying off debt and investing for your future. You can earn
        money now. Even while you eliminate your debt. And doing it this way, you can get rid of
        your debt faster, even while building wealth.
        <br /><br />
        Here’s how it works:
        <br /><br />
        First, we set up a special tax-advantaged vehicle called an Investment Grade Insurance
        Contract, or IGIC™. An IGIC is an investment vehicle with the following attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li
          >It is a liquid fund, much like a savings account, except that instead of growing at 0.1%
          in interest, it grows via guaranteed interest and non-guaranteed dividends at a rate that
          usually approaches or exceeds 5%.
        </li>
        <li>
          If used correctly (we will teach you how), all the growth in the account is tax-free and
          therefore creates a tax-free retirement fund. It’s a lot like a Roth account, but without
          the contribution limits, restrictive investment parameters, and lack of guarantees.
        </li>
        <li>
          When used through the GOLDEN program, it becomes a powerful tool for eliminating debt by
          converting interest accruing against you to interest earning in your favor.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can also be used to finance tax-free investments outside the fund (without any
          prohibited transactions).
        </li>
        <li>
          The IGIC is also a whole-life, permanent life insurance policy, which means it comes with
          a death benefit and living benefits (much like long-term care).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus, the IGIC is a savings account and emergency fund (but better because it is growing), a
        retirement account (but better because your principal is guaranteed against loss, and all
        funds used for retirement are not taxed), a debt-elimination program (but better because it
        gets rid of debt faster without having to sacrifice retirement contributions and growth),
        and a life insurance contract (but better than term because it is guaranteed and doesn’t
        expire).
        <br /><br />
        To set up the IGIC, we have to determine how much you can contribute. We do this by
        gathering information about your finances and figuring out how much you (1) have in liquid
        accounts accumulated that can be used to jump start your program and (2) are sending out the
        door to inefficient and inferior expenditures that we can redirect to a program where money
        will work for you forever:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Do you have a savings account/emergency fund? If so, let’s use it. Ours is a savings
          account and emergency fund, but better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you have a qualified account, like a 401(k), IRA, or SEP? If so, let’s use it. Ours is
          a retirement account, but better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Are you regularly contributing to a savings account or retirement account? If so, let’s
          redirect that money into this superior account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Are you paying for term insurance? If so, let’s redirect those premium payments. Ours is
          life insurance, but better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Are you overpaying on any of your debts? If so, let’s redirect the overpayments because
          ours is a debt elimination program, but better. Plus, we want that money working for you,
          not paying debt directly, where it will never work for you again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Armed with that information, we create an IGIC illustration. The advantage we have when we
        draw up an illustration for an IGIC is that, unlike qualified plans and other investments,
        the IGIC actually gives you a 30+ year projection of how your money will perform. We can
        combine those figures with information about your debt to show you how to optimize your
        money.
        <br /><br />
        With information about your debt, we can project using standard amortization tables, exactly
        how long it will take you to repay based on your current payment plan, and exactly how much
        interest you will end up paying. We provide that to you here for sake of comparison.
        <br /><br />
        Now we have two sets of information: We know how much each debt is shrinking every month as
        you make payments towards the debts, and we know how much your cash value is growing every
        month as you make premium payments. Then we let our program get to work.
        <br /><br />
        We optimize your debts for repayment (and usually it’s going to be the smallest debt first).
        Once the balance remaining on your debt reaches 80% of your growing cash value, you take out
        a loan from the insurance carrier for the exact balance of your debt, and you pay it off.
        <br /><br />
        Your cash value hasn’t changed. And the insurance company is still paying you interest and
        dividends on the entire cash value of your policy. But interest is only growing against you
        on part of it. So since your growth exceeds the interest against you, we have neutralized
        the debt interest, and you are actually getting paid to pay off your debt.
        <br /><br />
        Now, the monthly payment you were making towards that first debt goes into your program. And
        now those sums are working for you, forever. Instead of against you during your best earning
        years.
        <br /><br />
        We do the same thing for each successive debt. Once the shrinking balance of the debt
        matches 80% of the growing balance of your cash value, you take out a loan, pay off the debt
        completely, and then redirect the monthly payment you were making towards debt so you are
        now paying yourself.
        <br /><br />
        The result? Well, we’ll let your numbers speak for themselves (that’s what is on the next
        several pages), but you’ll get rid of your debts faster than you would otherwise, and you
        will have wealth growing for you. You’ll be GOLDEN!

        Under your current plan, you will spend the next {$debtyearsc} years paying
        <span> ${$totalrealdebtc|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> to eliminate
        <span>${$debtbalance|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> in principal and
        <span>${$interestc|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> in interest. Then, on
        <span>{$debtfreedatec}</span>, you’ll declare “Financial Freedom!” and finally be able to
        start saving for retirement. Except you’ve now lost <span>{$debtyearsc}</span> years off the
        steep-end of the growth curve of your investments. <br /><br />
        Instead, if you enroll in the GOLDEN program and let your money work hard for you in more
        than one place at a time, it will only take {$debtyears} years to pay
        <span>${$totalrealdebt|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> to eliminate
        <span>${$debtbalance|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> in principal and
        <span>${$interest|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> in interest. Then, on {$debtfreedate},
        you’ll be debt free and have <span>${$cashvalueg|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> working for
        you. Under the GOLDEN program, by the time you would have been debt free and broke under
        your current program (<span>{$debtfreedatec}</span>), you will have a total of
        <span>${$liquidityc|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> in a tax-free, liquid utility account
        (can be used for investing, savings, and retirement) and
        <span>${$passonc|number_format:0:’.':','}</span> that will be passed on to your heirs in the
        event of your death.
